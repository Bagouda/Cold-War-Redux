All [euu_target.GetAdjective] claims and cores on [POL.GetAdjective] controlled Prussia will be removed.\n§g--------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrussia was for many centuries a major power in north-central Europe, based around the cities of Berlin and Königsberg, and rose to particular prominence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Following its victory in the Austro-Prussian War, Prussia became the driving force in creating a German Empire that excluded Austria (a Kleindeutsches Reich) and in 1871 the King of Prussia became Emperor of Germany.\n\nFollowing the First World War, the new Free State of Prussia bore most of Germany's territorial losses but remained the dominant state of the Weimar Republic. Even before Hitler came to power, the Prussian government had been effectively abolished by the Preußenschlag of 1932. Following World War II, almost all of Germany's territorial losses again were from areas that had been part of Prussia.\n\nPrussia was officially abolished by Control Council Law No. 46, passed by the Allied occupation authorities, in 1947.§!"
