 SOV_paris_italy_desc:0 "We have fought hard to bring down the fascist regime in Italy, and now with the Paris Peace Treaty, we have the chance to take what is rightfully ours. The former Italian colonies in Africa are ripe for the taking and would expand our influence on the continent. However, we must also consider the cost of war reparations and the need to rebuild our own country. As we continue our fight against colonialism, we must decide whether the gains of seizing a colony outweigh the benefits of a peaceful settlement."
 SOV_paris_italy_colony:0 "Drop reparation against a colony"
 SOV_paris_italy_colony_desc:0 "Comrades, we have an opportunity to expand our influence in the world and bring the message of revolution to the oppressed people of the former Italian colonies. We can seize one of these territories in exchange for dropping the war reparation from Italy. This is a chance to show the world that we stand for anti-colonialism and a better future for all people. Let us not squander this opportunity, for the revolution waits for no one."
 SOV_paris_somalia:0 "Somalian protectorate"
 SOV_paris_somalia_desc:0 "As the Soviet Union, we believe that the people of Somalia should have the right to self-determination and independence. However, we also recognize the need for stability in the region and the potential threat of Western imperialist interests. Therefore, we propose the establishment of a Soviet protectorate in Somalia, where we can help to develop the country and protect it from external interference. In return, we seek to maintain a strategic presence in the region, and to further our anti-colonialist and socialist agendas."
 SOV_paris_cyrenaica:0 "Cyrenaica protectorate"
 SOV_paris_cyrenaica_desc:0 "We must secure our southern flank by establishing a protectorate in Cyrenaica. The colonial exploitation by the West must come to an end, and we will show the people of Libya the benefits of socialism. We will use the resources of the land to rebuild our country and spread the revolution to our African brothers and sisters. The West will try to stop us, but we will stand strong and defend our gains."
 SOV_paris_italy_reparation:0 "Reparation with northen industry"
 SOV_paris_italy_reparation_desc:0 "We have chosen to accept war reparations from Italy instead of grabbing one of its former colonies. While a colony would expand our influence and anti-colonialist efforts, war reparations will provide us with much-needed resources and serve as a warning to future aggressors."
 SOV_paris_silesia:0 "The Silesian question"
 SOV_paris_silesia_desc:0 "We have occupied Silesia, as we promised it to Poland in exchange for Konigsberg. However, it seems that both Poland and Germany now lay claims to this territory, which has a significant German population. We must decide whether to keep our promise to Poland or appease the Germans and give them back their land. Our decision will have consequences, but we must remain strong and resolute in the face of opposition."
 SOV_paris_polish_silesia:0 "Polish Silesia"
 SOV_paris_polish_silesia_desc:0 "As we consider the fate of Silesia, we must not forget our commitment to creating a strong and independent Poland. The German state has fallen, and it is time to look towards the future. By giving Silesia to Poland, we establish a united and prosperous Polish state, which will be a powerful ally and an important bulwark against the Western imperialists. Let us not be swayed by the cries of the Germans - our allegiance is to the Polish people, and to the bright socialist future we are building together."
 SOV_paris_german_silesia:0 "German Silesia"
 SOV_paris_german_silesia_desc:0 "We have decided to give Silesia back to Germany. The Soviet Union needs a strong ally in Germany to counterbalance the Western powers. By restoring Silesia to Germany, we can gain the support of the German people and strengthen our position in Europe. The German people are not to be blamed for the actions of their past leaders, and we should not hold them responsible. We must work together with Germany to build a new and better Europe."
 SOV_paris_baltic:0 "The Baltic situation"
 SOV_paris_baltic_desc:0 "Our victory in the war has given us a great opportunity to shape the future of Europe. The fate of Finland and the strategic island of Bornholm will be our decision to make, and we must use it to our advantage. Our grip on the Baltic must remain firm, and any threats to our security must be neutralized. We will make sure that our demands are met, and that the Soviet Union remains the preeminent power in the region."
 SOV_paris_finland:0 "Secure Finland"
 SOV_paris_finland_desc:0 "Finland, a country which has caused us great suffering and pain in the past, must now be dealt with accordingly. We must establish a buffer zone between ourselves and the capitalist west, and Finland will serve as a crucial buffer. We will make sure that our demands are met, and that the Finnish government is aligned with our interests. Our victory in the war has given us the power to shape the future of Europe, and we must use that power to ensure the safety and security of the Soviet Union."
 SOV_paris_finland_guarantee:0 "Neutral Finland"
 SOV_paris_finland_guarantee_desc:0 "As we move forward in the post-war world, it is important to establish a neutral Finland. We cannot risk the possibility of the country aligning itself with the West, and so we must make sure that it remains independent, yet aligned with our interests. The Porkkala Naval Base is a crucial security point for us, and we must maintain our control over it. By establishing a neutral Finland and keeping our hold on the naval base, we can ensure the safety and security of our borders."
 SOV_paris_finland_puppet:0 "Soviet Finland"
 SOV_paris_finland_puppet_desc:0 "Puppeting Finland may be a risky move, as it could be seen as an act of aggression by the West. However, we must consider the long-term strategic benefits of having a friendly regime in control of such a strategic location. We must tread carefully and ensure that the transition is smooth and relatively peaceful, but ultimately, we cannot afford to allow Finland to remain independent and potentially align with our enemies. We must secure our borders and maintain our dominance in the region, no matter the cost."
 SOV_paris_danemark:0 "Danemark Diplomacy"
 SOV_paris_danemark_desc:0 "As we stand at the crossroads of history, we must weigh our options carefully. We have the power to keep the strategic island of Bornholm and establish a naval base, but at what cost? Will we risk the ire of the West? Alternatively, we could return the island to Denmark in exchange for their neutrality. The decision is a difficult one, but we must remain vigilant and always put our security first."
 SOV_paris_bornmol_against_guarantee:0 "Bornholm against neutrality"
 SOV_paris_bornmol_against_guarantee_desc:0 "As the Soviet Union, we have decided to give back the island of Bornholm to Denmark under the condition of their neutrality. While some may view this as a loss, we see it as a victory in preventing Denmark from aligning with the West. We must maintain our influence in the Baltic and a neutral Denmark will allow for stability in the region."
 SOV_paris_keep_bornmol:0 "Keep Bornholm"
 SOV_paris_keep_bornmol_desc:0 "We have fought long and hard for our victories in the Great Patriotic War. The Baltic Sea must be secured for the Soviet Union. Bornholm offers a strategic location to establish a naval base, giving us control of the entrance to the Baltic and access to the rest of Scandinavia. The West may see it as aggression, but we must be vigilant in our defense of the Motherland. Bornholm will be ours."
 SOV_fate_of_transylvania:0 "The Transylvanian Question"
 SOV_fate_of_transylvania_desc:0 "The fate of Transylvania has been a contentious issue since the beggining of the century. It's now our time to cut this gordian knot once and for all. Our stance will significantly impact regional dynamics and our relations with neighboring countries."
 SOV_FATE_OF_TRANSYLVANIA_EFFECT_DESC:0 "If no decision regarding [76.GetName] is made by the Soviet government the territory will be handed to §H[ROM.GetNameWithFlag]§! once the Paris Peace Treaty is adoped by the UN Security Council."
 SOV_transylvania_referendum:0 "Transylvanian Referendum"
 SOV_transylvania_referendum_desc:0 "The only solution to the Transylvania torn is to set up an independent republic. This would anger romanian and hungarian alike but set the stage for more stable regional balance."
 SOV_TRANSYLVANIA_REFERENDUM_EFFECT_DESC:0 "This may allow the establishment of an independent Transylvanian Soviet republic.\n\n"
 SOV_hungarian_transylvania:0 "Hungarian Transylvania"
 SOV_hungarian_transylvania_desc:0 "Hungarian have historical claims to Transylvania, we should fulfill their wish of a greater hungary, potentially bringing Hungary closer into our sphere of influence. This would anger the romanian"
 SOV_romanian_transylvania:0 "Romanian Transylvania"
 SOV_romanian_transylvania_desc:0 "We can't go back to the reactionary status quo. Romanian control over Transylvania reinforces our relationship with Romania, ensuring their continued loyalty to the Soviet bloc. This would anger the hungarian"
 SOV_paris_finish:0 "Sign the Paris Accord"
