CW_CWM_SPLASH_FEATURES:0 "§WWelcome to the Cold War Mod.\n\nWhile this version of the mod is not complete, it does feature a few unique game mechanics. This introduction will explain how to access the new mechanics and give some general pointers.\n\nPlease note that the mod is focused more on indirect action, proxy wars and diplomacy rather than direct confrontation between countries.\n\nThe mod uses a unique notification system to notify you about the UN Security Council and other mechanics introduced in the mod.\n\nSome actions may have an effect on world tension so be sure to check the world tension screen often, these may also reveal opportunities for you to take advantage of, such as when a country may be eligible for sanctions by the UN Security Council.\n\nFor more information click the FAQ button.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                           §H- United Nations Security Council -§!\n\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) represents the new post-WW2 world order and is an organisation meant to safeguard this order by consensus, which is achieved via the various resolutions being voted upon at the UNSC.\n\nYou can access the UNSC interface by clicking the button with the UN logo at the top bar. The UNSC and its member states may take action against countries that exhibit aggressive behaviour towards other countries.\n\nBy gathering support from other countries you can ensure that resolutions you draft on the UNSC will be adopted. These resolutions can be used to advance your own goals and weaken your rivals.\n\n§HImportant!§! Democratic countries can only declare war on other countries when a certain amount of world tension has been reached or authorization has been given to them from the UNSC by passing the relevant resolution.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                         §H- Unique Economic Aid Programs -§!\n\nThe [SOV.GetName] and the [USA.GetName] can launch their unique aid programs, which aid smaller countries in various ways while at the same time promoting the ideology of each respectively.\n\nTo unlock these aid programs, you will have to finish the relevant focus for each country. Countries who receive [USA.GetAdjective] or [SOV.GetAdjective] aid are more likely to support them on the UNSC and will generally be more friendly towards them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                     §H- Unique State Actions -§!\n\nYou can perform various actions both on your own states and states of other countries. These actions are context sensitive, so it may be possible to perform one action on a particular state but not on another.\n\nFor example, you can lease small islands for a period of time from other countries to establish a strategic foothold in a region that is otherwise inaccessible to you.\n\nYou can also upgrade some of your states to allow you to build more buildings in that state which can significantly increase your industrial power even if you are playing a small nation. This action can also be performed on your puppet states, if you have any.§!"

CW_CWM_SPLASH_FAQ:0 "                                               §HFrequently asked questions§!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n§W§HHow come I can't finish all the focuses?§!\nThe focuses introduced in the mod are about making choices and often compromising, its okay if you don't manage to do all the focuses, try doing the focuses you didn't manage to complete in a different play through and see how that changes your game experience.\n\n§HHow do I become a permanent member of the UNSC?§!\nThe only way for your country to gain a permanent seat on the UNSC is to remove another country, countries who have generated a lot of world tension may be voted to be removed from the UNSC.\n\n§HIs there more info on the new mechanics?§!\nLook for the ? icon in the new interfaces, this icon will provide you with more information about each interface and how you can use it.\n\n§HHow come I can't see focuses of other countries?§!\nYou can set focus visibility in the game lobby before you start a new game, click on the "Custom Game Rules" button and choose one of the options.\n\n§HWhy are so many borders inaccurate?§!\nWhile the mod is in alpha stage, the priority is to work on bugs, fix crashes and ensure solid gameplay. Borders will be fixed in the upcoming updates but visual aspects such as borders are a secondary priority at the moment.\n\n§HWill there be more focus trees?§!\nYes, these take a while to make since they require plenty of research and testing.\n\n§HWill generals be added to the mod?§!\nYes, along with their portraits and historical traits.\n\n§HWhy is the tech tree disabled?§!\nThe tech tree will be unlocked once it is introduced into the mod, there was simply not enough time to develop the techs properly and introduce all the features the mod currently has.\n\n§HWhere can I report bugs?§!\nYou can report bugs and suggest improvements either on the Steam page (click on Discussions at the top) or on the Discrod server.§!"
