 spain_intervention.5.d:0 "The war in Spain has been a catastrophic failure for the anti-fascist coalition lead by the United States. Despite their best efforts, General Franco's forces were able to defeat the coalition and install a friendly government in Paris. France has become almost a puppet of Spain, and the coalition's failure has resulted in the formation of an unaligned far-right faction in the Cold War called 'The Third Way.' This is a devastating blow for the United States, whose reputation as a defender of democracy and a bulwark against unaligned_right has been severely tarnished. The failure of the coalition in Spain will have far-reaching consequences for the balance of power in Europe and beyond."
