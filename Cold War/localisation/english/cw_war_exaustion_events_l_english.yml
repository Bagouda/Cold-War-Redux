 cw_war_exaustion_events.1.d:0 "A demonstration has taken place in the capital, the demonstrations are calling for an end to the war and the return of [ROOT.GetAdjective] troops back home.\n\nThe demonstration was not significant in size and overall it seems like the majority of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] public supports the war but clearly some are becoming discontent with the war.\n\nIf our $WAR_SUPPORT$ continues to drop we may face further actions by the public against the war."
